        <b>Mariana</b> is the owner and the lead designer of Mangata and Gallo.
        After graduating from design school with a specialization in diamond
        cutting and metal smithing, Mariana opened a store in her hometown,
        Austin and started to grow her business online. Mariana has always
        managed every aspect of the business, from jewelry design to marketing
        to e-commerce. However, she recently hired several artisans to help
        craft her designs and a young employee to help manage the company
        website and social media accounts.
